# CHIPSPIPE_flowchart

This flowchart is made for understanding the overview of how CHIPSPIPE(CHIME/Pulsar Pipeline)

This pipeline is fed a filterbank format file .

filterbank file - consist of a header and data section where header consist of data specifications and data consist of 2D array of time and frequency recorded by telescope 

* **Step 1** - Get data in search mode of CHIME/Pulsar
* **Step 2** - Remove RFI by using `rfifind` PRESTO tool (known bad channel will be masked )
* **Step 3** - Dropped packet issue resolved by using `fdp_submit_jobs.sh *.fil` if you have higher resolution file  `fdp_htr.py`
  > within 4.5σ if  there is a droppout it is replaced by the median  for each frequency channel  
* **Step 4** - coherant De-dispersion of  1024 frequency channel around nominal DM 
* **Step 5** - A small range of DM check is done ±20 pc cm<sup>-1</sup>  by `prepsubband` tool of PRESTO  
* **Step 6** - Each file is then searched for single pulse using `single_pulse_search.py` tool of PRESTO
   > output of this contains a series of text files containing single pulse time of arrivals(TOAs), SNRs and searched boxcar widths 
* **Step 7** - Output of `single_pulse_search.py` is fed to `SPEGID`(Single Pulse Event Grouping IDentification ) which grades signal .  
* **Step 8** - Output of SPEGID is then fed to `FETCH`(Fast Extragalactic Transient Candidate Hunter)
   > FETCH is a deep-learning based classifier used to detect impulsive bursts from sigproc-filterbank data 
* **Step 9** - Now human verification of diagnostic waterfall plots as well as a corresponding grade generated by `FETCH` .
